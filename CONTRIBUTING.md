# Getting help

Since this is a personal project, do not expect timely support. I will go through issues when I can, but I am not making any commitments to when an issue will be fixed or a timeline for responding to an issue.

If you have found a crash caused by this library, please include the following with your issue:

- A minified POC
- Root cause analysis (at bare minimum, explain what you believe is causing the crash and steps you've taken to draw that conclusion, or an explanation of what you've tried if you were unable to determine the cause of the crash)
- Calling convention information (what calling convention the target function uses)

**DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE ASKING ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO GAME HACKING, MALWARE, OR CRACKING.**

These topics are out of scope of this project and any issue on this topic will be closed.
